# What is the aim of this repository ?
This repo just stores all the little exercizes that I did to learn Python programming and how to use Git and Github. <br />
<br />
This is if you want to add an image without resizing it:
`![Autumn Landscape Image](https://github.com/ManuelaCarriero/gym/blob/main/Images/Dreaming.jpg)`
If you want to choose the size:
`<img src="https://github.com/ManuelaCarriero/gym/blob/main/Images/Dreaming.jpg" width="100">`
This is our sweet image:
<img src="https://github.com/ManuelaCarriero/gym/blob/main/Images/Dreaming.jpg" width="100">
<br />
Hoping to have a walk in a countryside like this soon,
*Cheers!* <br />
Manuela
